This project was for my own personal virtual CV, but mostly for me to learn and gain a better understanding of frontend development using CSS and JavaScript.
I also used this project to start playing around with themes and learn how to integrate theme toggles.
This is a 100% beginner website and I have learned a lot about deployment and JS fundamentals.
From here I have begun to learn other frontend technologies and frontend frameworks such as react and vue which you can see in the work I've done for other GitHub organizations that I am a part of
